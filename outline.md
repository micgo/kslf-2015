# Infrastructure as Code

### Evolution of a System Administrator

* ssh into a server and start banging around
* store notes in ~/server.txt
* move notes to the wiki
  * nervous when you hit enter
  * smart when you hit save
  * despondent when you realize the wiki is now a lie
* start writing some scripts (setup.sh, etc.)
* golden images
* Need an automation framework!
  * policy-driven configuration management

### Benefits of Automation

* speed
* scale
* consistency

### Dimensions of Scale

* Number of servers
* Staff
* Time to market
* Complexity

### Automation Platform

* Creates a dependable view of your entire networkâ€™s state.
* Can handle complex dependencies among the nodes of your network.
* Is fault tolerant.
* Is secure.
* Can handle multiple platforms
* Can manage cloud resources
* Provides a foundation for innovation

### Infrastructure as Code

* Programmatically provision and configure components
* Treat like any other code base
* Reconstruct business from code repository, data backup, and compute resources

### Polciy-based

* You capture the policy for your infrastructure in code
* A program ensures each node in your infrastructure complies with the policy
* A control loop keeps the system stable and allows for change when policy is updated

### Golden Images vs. Policy-based

* Typical Infrastructure
* New compliance mandate
* 6 Golden Images updates
* 12 instance replacements
* Completed during maintenance windows
* Configuration has changed
