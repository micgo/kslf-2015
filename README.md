# Introduction to Infrastructure as Code & Automation / Introduction to Chef

Your customers expect you to continuously deliver delightful experiences. This means that you’ll need to continuously deliver application and infrastructure updates. Hand-crafted servers lovingly built and maintained by a system administrator are a thing of the past. Golden images are fine for initial provisioning but will quickly fail as your configuration requirements change over time.

It’s time for you to fully automate the provisioning and management of your infrastructure components. Welcome to the world of infrastructure as code! In this new world, you’ll be able to programmatically provision and configure the components of your infrastructure.

Disposable infrastructure whose provisioning, configuration, and on-going maintenance is fully automated allow you to change the way you build and deliver applications. Move your applications and infrastructure towards continuous delivery.

In this talk, we’ll explore the ideas behind “infrastructure as code” and, specifically, look at how Chef allows you to fully automate your infrastructure. If you’re brave enough, we’ll even let you get your hands on some Chef and experience the delight of using Chef to build and deploy some infrastructure components.
